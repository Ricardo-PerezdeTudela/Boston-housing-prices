In this project the Boston housing dataset is employed 
to explore linear one-feature and multiple regression techniques

Linear regression:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): pairplot, correlation heatmap
- Feature selection: based on higher correlation
- Linear regression: spotting of outliers
- Robust regression: RANSAC
- Performance evaluation of regression: residual analysis, MSE, R^2

Multiple regression:

- Multiple regression using the statsmodel package
- Detecting collinearity between predictors (features)
- Feature importance
- Feature standardization
